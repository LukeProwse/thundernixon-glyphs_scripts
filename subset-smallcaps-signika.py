#MenuTitle: Subset Signika Smallcaps for Gfonts
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
__doc__="""
Make a separate glyphs file that replaces lowercase glyphs with small caps, for exporting via FontMake.

- Finds all lowercase correlaries to smallcap glyphs, and removes them
- Removes ".smcp" suffix from smallcap names to map them to default lowercase
- Triggers a feature code update
- Updates family name and instances (this is especially specific to Signika)

This script takes care to not disrupt component glyphs, kerning, or features. 

Currently specific to Sigkika, but could be modified/extended for other families fairly easily.
