# Glyphs Scripts

Python scripts for [Glyphs App](https://glyphsapp.com/).

Scripts that are working well go into the `master` branch. Scripts that may be in a work-in-progress state are in the `wip` branch.

Note to self: pull in updates between branches with `git merge master --no-commit`, in order to review changes (especially deleted WIP scripts) before committing them. 

## ðŸš¨ Before using ðŸš¨

These scripts are quick tools for working with fonts in progress. Most of the code is specific to my current work, and is not necessarily made to work with any arbitrary font file. 

Before using a script, please read (at minimum) the docstring for each script to know the what it does and if variables should be set inside the code before use. Where variables should be set before use, these lines of code are clearly commented. Always have backups of you work before running scripts that will edit data, and check results before saving. Ideally, read and know what entire scripts will do before using them.

# More Information

*The following is adapted from [mekkablue/Glyphs-Scripts](https://github.com/mekkablue/Glyphs-Scripts).*

## Installation

Put the scripts into the *Scripts* folder which appears when you choose *Script > Open Scripts Folder* (Cmd-Shift-Y). Then, hold down the Option (Alt) key, and choose *Script > Reload Scripts* (Cmd-Opt-Shift-Y). Now the scripts are visible in the *Script* menu

For some of the scripts, you will also need to install Tal Leming's *Vanilla*: Go to *Glyphs > Preferences > Addons > Modules* and click the *Install Modules* button. Thatâ€™s it.

## Troubleshooting

Please report problems and request features [as a GitHub issue](/issues). Make sure you have the latest version of the scripts and your app is up to date. And please, always **indicate both your Glyphs and macOS version.** You can also reach out to me on Twitter ([@thundernixon](https://twitter.com/thundernixon)) if you have any comments or questions. Thank you.


## Requirements

The scripts require Glyphs 2.x running on macOS 10.9 or later. I can only test them and make them work in the latest version of the software.
